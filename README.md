# PDF Sucks for devs

If you ever had to work with PDF file format you definitely know what I mean:

- Want to extract a table? Good luck. People have even built AI solutions just to deal with this headache.
- Working with multiple languages? Exchanging templates? Might as well start from scratch.
- Need to edit a PDF? Enjoy paying for specialized, often proprietary tools.
- Using PDFs in AI workflows? Step one: wrestle the data into something usable.
- Opening the same doc on different devices? Forget adaptabilityâ€”PDF isn't here for that.

# HTML to the rescue

We have now a format that is widely used and myriad of open source tools to play with it: The allmighty HTML.
The different engines have a similar rendering process so we should be able to match PDF quality.
With just some restrictions and a pagination you could easily create a new file format that could greatly improve the miserable life of developper.
I am fed up waiting for this format to appear so let's create it.

# WDOC: Simple Spec

WDOC files are just a zip archive containing an `index.html` as the starting point. Thatâ€™s it.

### Core Principles:

1.  **HTML Inside**: Put all HTML content in a zip file with a `.wdoc` extension.
2.  **Paginated Content**: For print-ready, paginated documents, encapsulate content using:
    ```
    <section class="wdoc_page" format="A4">
    <!-- Your page content here -->
    </section>
    ```

# WDOC limitations

To ensure security and simplicity, some restrictions are in place:

- **No JavaScript**: We need a plugin system but want to avoid turning documents into malware and advertisement breeding grounds.
- **No External CSS**: All styles should be self-contained within the zip file.
- **Image Validation**: Users should approve external images to prevent pixel tracking.
- **Font Support**: A limited set of fonts, with the option to import from trusted sources like Google Fonts.

# What WDOC Needs to Succeed

For WDOC to become a real alternative to PDF, hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll need:

- [ ] An app on each platform to read and edit wdoc files (maybe fork later on ligthweight reader + bigger editor) - flutter seems to be a good candidate for that
- [ ] 2 modes of writing, free flow where we take the content and create the wdoc-page elements and another mode where the creator is responsible for putting the wdoc-page tags
- [ ] An importer of pdf and word docs to cuckoo nest existing document solutions
- [ ] Support of google docs import (via save as a zipped file in google doc)
- [ ] A spec validator to ensure cross-browser rendering fidelity and guarantee WYSIWYG consistency + doc specs.
- [ ] Form handling with data storage/extraction, and support for file uploads (imagine docs containing other docsâ€”wild).
- [ ] File annotation
- [ ] File versioning using an embedded git
- [ ] Password protection (e.g., encrypt the file and include a manifest.json for metadata).
- [ ] E-signature (maybe for this a company side of the spec to timestamp and validate signature) check XAdES
- [ ] A plugin system where additional functionality could be added. Need something Ã  la htmx inside document to bypass the no javascript limitation
- [ ] A serious push to build awareness and adoption. The usual chicken-and-egg problem applies.

# Devs Will Prevail ðŸ’ª

Letâ€™s face it, business owners and stakeholders donâ€™t care about file formats. PDFs "work" for them.

But for developers, the struggle is real. WDOC is our chance to take back control. It wonâ€™t be easy, but with a community of passionate devs, we can make it happen.
